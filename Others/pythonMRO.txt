How MRO choose the order of the classes inherited:

The merge is computed according to the following rule
take the head of the first list, i.e L[B1][0];
if this head is not in the tail of any of the other lists,
then add it to the linearization of C and remove it from the lists in the merge,
otherwise look at the head of the next list and take it, if it is a good head.
Then repeat the operation until all the class are removed or
it is impossible to find good heads.

Refer to the example on Wiki:
